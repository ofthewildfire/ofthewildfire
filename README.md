# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kaycee! 

Frontend developer using HTML/ CSS and JavaScript with a smidge of React.js. I also really **really** like APIs. 

In my spare time I like to read (literally anything, from non-fiction to fantasy fiction.) & watch mystery television shows and documentaries. 

~~and eat cookies, without sharing of course~~
