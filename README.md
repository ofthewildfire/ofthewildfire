I'm a self-taught developer with experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. I've also gained some college credits in computer science, where I learned the basics of Java and Python. I'm currently focused on building projects with the MERN stack and TypeScript.

## 🌟 What I'm Up To
- **Freelancing**: Offering web development services and working on exciting new projects.
